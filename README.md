# Moodboard
The premise behind this application is to make a dynamic blog where someone does not have to create blog posts and upload pictures to their blog. The blog updates itself based on what the user has been liking and posting on various social media sites. For now, the blog queries a user's likes from Tumblr, Facebook, and Spotify. Their is a viewable, working, prototype for me available on ogonwodoh.com/moodboard.php . This will soon be developed into an Android application.

This is how the application works so far:
A user (for now, me) likes a Facebook page or makes a post on their Tumblr.
On page load, my application queries the Facebook and Tumblr APIs to get a user's recent likes or posts. 
The images of the liked pages or posts are displayed on my page.
Also, once a day, my application sends out an email to the user asking about a status update. 
The user responds to the email with an update.
This update is displayed on my blog.

Next steps:
Creating an archive and making the actual Android application!
