# Moodboard
The premise behind this application is to make a dynamic blog where someone does not have to create blog posts and upload pictures to their blog. The blog updates itself based on what the user has been liking and posting on various social media sites. For now, the blog queries a user's likes from Tumblr, Facebook, and Spotify. Their is a viewable, working, prototype for me available on ogonwodoh.com/moodboard.php . This will soon be developed into an Android application.
